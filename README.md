## 🕹️ Game Features
1. **Snake**: Traditional snake gameplay
2. **Nitro**: Double click in 1 direction to get a nitro boost, which speeds up the dull parts of the game
3. **Win the Game**: Unlike traditional snake, you can win this game in 2 ways. You can either eat 64 honeys, or eat a honey while filling up all edges with Pooh's tail.
4. **High scores**: Save and display high scores for "Honey Eaten" to see where you rank.
5. **Pooh Bear graphics**: Watch Pooh Bear's head chase honey around. Each honey gives a randomly colored tail.
